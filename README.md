# GithubWorkshop
Hello LUG members!

This code is borrowed from this lovely person's Github Gist: https://gist.github.com/Estherns/35929cf33ab7797ead7da6289df2fbac

Clone this github! 

Then use python to run it
````
python tictactoe.py
````

Then create a branch of your very own and modify it as you see fit XD
